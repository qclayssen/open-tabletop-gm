"""Block badges must actually run, and must not be English-only by construction.

WHY
===
The badge feature existed as three disconnected pieces: a keyword table, a
function that built an <img>, and a CSS class. `_addBlockBadge` was never
called from anywhere, and `.block-badge` had no style rule at all. So no player
in any language had ever seen one — the "English-only keyword list" was a
symptom of code that never ran.

Wiring it as-written would have shipped a feature that works only for English
narration. Two things prevent that:

  * block KIND (npc / dice / tutor) is badged with no word list at all, so that
    path works in every language;
  * the semantic word table lives in the system's ui.json, so a system or
    campaign in another language overrides it instead of editing the display.
