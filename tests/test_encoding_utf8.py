"""Campaign text must survive a non-UTF-8 default encoding.

WHY (#36)
=========

A Russian-language user reported their in-world date rendering as

    18 РЎРµСЂРїР°РЅСЊ, 412 РѕС‚ РџР°РґРµРЅРёСЏ РЎРІРѕРґРѕРІ

instead of

    18 Серпань, 412 от Падения Сводов

That is the signature of UTF-8 bytes decoded as cp1251, the Windows ANSI code
page for Russian. Python's `open()` uses the locale encoding when none is
given, so on any non-English Windows install every bare `open()` in the tree
was a corruption site. The same bug arrives as GBK/cp936 for Chinese users,
which is what two separate contributors reported against the sibling repo.

It never fails on the developer's machine, because macOS and Linux default to
UTF-8 and the bug is invisible there. So it needs a detector that does not
depend on the platform the tests happen to run on.

TWO DETECTORS, BECAUSE NEITHER IS ENOUGH ALONE
==============================================

1. `-X warn_default_encoding` is Python's own mechanism for this. It fires an
   EncodingWarning on any text-mode open that relied on the default, and it
   catches `read_text`/`write_text` too, which a regex over the source does
   not. But it only sees code that actually RUNS.
2. A static sweep of the tree catches the paths a test never executes, which is
   most of them.
