"""Every icon the display asks for must exist, and something must serve them.

WHY (#37)
=========

`open-tabletop-gm` was forked from `claude-dnd-skill`, and the fork carried the
templates but not `display/icons/` nor the Flask route that serves it. The
result was a 404 on every icon in the UI:

    127.0.0.1 - - [22/Aug/2026 19:52:47] "GET /icons/logo_primary_fullcolor.png HTTP/1.1" 404 -

Nothing anywhere failed. Flask returns 404 for an unrouted path, the browser
renders a blank box for a broken <img>, and the server keeps serving. The only
detector was a user looking at the screen and saying the icons were missing.

So this file is the detector: it reads the icon names out of the display's own
sources the same way the browser does — static `/icons/x.png` hrefs in the
template, plus the three tables the JS builds names from at runtime — and
asserts each one is a real file. A dynamic name is exactly the kind that
survives review, because grepping for its literal path finds nothing.
