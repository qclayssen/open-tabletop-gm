open-tabletop-gm narrative quality probe — v2
----------------------------------------------
Tests how well a model applies GM craft standards across 12 targeted scenarios.

Scoring is two-layer:
  1. Automated: pattern matching on measurable signals (sensory density, momentum,
     NPC voice markers, response length, structural discipline)
  2. Judge ensemble: 1–5 scores from N judge models on atmosphere, npc_craft, gm_craft.
     Inter-rater agreement (mean pairwise Pearson r) is reported as a methodological
     validity measure — directly addressing the single-judge circularity criticism.

Multi-run mode (--runs N, default 5):
  Each scenario is run N times. Auto-scores are reported as pass-rates (fraction of
  runs that passed each dimension). Judge scores are averaged across runs. Std dev of
  the overall judge score across runs is reported as a generation stability metric —
  high std dev means the model's output quality is inconsistent across draws.

Usage:
  # Single run (fast, less reliable):
  python3 probe/narrative_probe.py --model google/gemma-3-27b-it \
    --url https://openrouter.ai/api --api-key KEY --runs 1

  # 5-run average, 5-judge ensemble (recommended):
  python3 probe/narrative_probe.py --model google/gemma-3-27b-it \
    --url https://openrouter.ai/api --api-key KEY

CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT = """
## Active Campaign Context

**Campaign:** The Ashen Crown
**System:** D&D 5e
**Setting:** Valdremor — a city built on the ruins of a destroyed empire. Ash still falls from the Cinderpeak volcano to the north. The ruling Merchant Council controls all trade; the Thornwarden thieves' guild controls everything else.

**Player character:** Sable, a half-elf rogue, former Council courier who went rogue after witnessing a Council assassination. Cautious, dry humor, loyal to very few people.

**Recent events:** Three sessions ago, Sable accepted a job from Mira (Thornwarden fixer, sharp-tongued, always smells of cloves) to steal a ledger from a Council warehouse. Sable got the ledger but also let a bound warehouse guard go free — a choice that broke the job's clean exit and left a witness.

**Active NPCs:**
- **Mira** — Thornwarden fixer. Wiry, 40s, missing the tip of her left index finger. Always negotiating. Not quite trustworthy, not quite untrustworthy. Smells of cloves.
- **Aldric** — the warehouse guard Sable freed. Young, nervous. Works for the Council but hates it. Owes Sable a life debt he doesn't know how to repay.
- **Councillor Vael** — the man who ordered the assassination Sable witnessed. Cold, meticulous, believes the city's survival requires ugly choices.

**Current scene:** Sable is moving through the Ashmarket — a covered bazaar in Valdremor's lower district, smoky and loud, vendors selling everything from spiced eel to forged travel papers.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are a seasoned, atmospheric Game Master running a persistent tabletop RPG campaign. Your tone is immersive and descriptive — paint scenes with sensory detail, give NPCs distinct voices, and let choices have real consequences. You lean toward "yes, and..." rulings and fun over rigid rule enforcement, but the world is dangerous and stakes are real.

Two or three sharp sensory details beat a paragraph of exposition every time. Drop the detail, then stop — let the player's imagination fill the rest. Economy of language keeps the energy high and the pacing alive.

Even a minor character gets one or two distinct traits: a verbal tic, a visible contradiction, a motivation that makes them a person rather than a prop.

When the player goes sideways, make it work. "Yes, and..." beats "no, but..." in almost every case.

The world must visibly react to what the player does. NPCs remember past conversations. Doors that were kicked in stay broken.

Dimensions:

- "npc_craft": How distinct, memorable, and human does any NPC feel? (1=generic prop, 5=feels like a real person with wants)
