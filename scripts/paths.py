paths.py — canonical path resolution for open-tabletop-gm campaign and character data.

All scripts that need to locate campaign or character files should import from
here rather than hardcoding ~/open-tabletop-gm/. Set GM_CAMPAIGN_ROOT to move
your data anywhere — iCloud, Dropbox, network share, etc. Defaults to
~/open-tabletop-gm.

Usage:
    from paths import campaigns_dir, characters_dir, campaign_dir, find_campaign

Environment:
    GM_CAMPAIGN_ROOT    Root of campaign data tree. Default: ~/open-tabletop-gm
                        Example: export GM_CAMPAIGN_ROOT=~/Dropbox/gm
